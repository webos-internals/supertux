-SuperTux for webOS

	---------------------------------------
	This is a port of the classic 
	opensource jump'n run game SuperTux.

	The default controls use the  
	accelerometer for movement and the 
	gesture bar for action/jump.
	
	Menus may be navigated by tilting the 
	device or simply by tapping a menu item
	on the screen.
	
	Tilt the device left and right to move 
	tux, tilt down to duck while tux is 
	grown, and tap the gesture area to the 
	left or right of center to jump 
	(hold for a higher jump).  When tux 
	has fireball powers, tap anywhere on 
	the screen to shoot a fireball.

	Tip: make sure to tap the gesture area 
	to the left or right of center so as to 
	not minimize the card.
	
	Enjoy!
